# log-parsing

This project focuses on practical log parsing and normalization using Python.

The goal is to extract structured detection-relevant fields from raw and JSON log data and prepare them for downstream analysis or enrichment.

---

## Objectives

- Parse JSON-based security logs
- Extract key detection fields (IP, user, timestamp, event type)
- Normalize output into structured CSV/JSON
- Use regex to extract fields from raw log formats
- Demonstrate clean, modular Python structure

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- JSON handling
- File I/O
- Regex with named capture groups
- Field normalization
- Basic data transformation workflows

---

## Example Use Cases

- Extracting suspicious IP activity from web server logs
- Parsing authentication logs for user anomaly review
- Preparing telemetry for enrichment pipelines

## Notes

All data used in this project is synthetic or publicly available.  
The focus is on detection-relevant field extraction and clarity of implementation rather than production hardening.
